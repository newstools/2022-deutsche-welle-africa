After a fire razed most of the Karume Market in Dar es Salaam, thousands of Tanzanian traders want to return. But authorities have banned business, at the market until an investigation into the fire is completed. Inappropriate materials like wood and plastic made the fire worse. Few buildings had basic rescue equipment. By 2035, Dar es Salaam will be home to over twenty million people and experts say safe structures for traders are vital.
