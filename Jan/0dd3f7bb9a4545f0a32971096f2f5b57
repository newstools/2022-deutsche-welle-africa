Aisha Dafalla was just 17 when she donated blood for the first time in school. Back then, she fainted and never thought of donating blood again. But when her workmate’s brother had an accident, she changed her mind. Today, she is calling on Kenyans to follow her example through her Blood Donor Champion Network. Aisha has so far donated blood 68 times - and encourages everyone to do the same.
