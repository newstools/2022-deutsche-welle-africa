On April Fools' Day, Germany were left smiling after the 2022 World Cup draw. Hansi Flick's side were drawn in Group E against Spain, Japan, and whoever wins the interconfederation playoff between Costa Rica and New Zealand. Flick was assistant coach when Germany suffered consecutive defeats to Spain in the 2008 European Championships and the 2010 World Cup, giving him a good understanding of the evolution of the side. Japan is perhaps the surprise team of the group, but ultimately Germany has to feel confident about finishing top. Belgium, Croatia, Canada and Morocco leave Group F looking like the trickiest to predict. Hosts Qatar were put in Group A with the Netherlands, Senegal and Ecuador. The tournament in Qatar, the first World Cup ever in the Middle East, has come under heavy criticism and scrutiny since it was awarded back in 2010, with concerns about the country's policies regarding the working conditions of migrant workers. Human Rights Watch recently slammed FIFA's awarding of the tournament to the Gulf country. Protests call for Qatar to change policies regarding the labor conditions of migrants FIFA President Gianni Infantino said the tournament would be "the greatest World Cup ever" and that "the world will be united in Qatar." The three remaining spots will be decided in June. In Europe, Wales will play the winner of Scotland vs. Ukraine, a playoff game postponed due to the war in Ukraine. In the inter-confederation playoffs, Costa Rica play New Zealand with the winner taking the final place in Group E. Elsewhere, Australia will take on UAE for the right to play Peru for a spot in Group D with defending champions France. The 2022 World Cup will start on November 21, when Qatar play Ecuador in the opening game.
