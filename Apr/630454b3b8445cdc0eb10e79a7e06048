Five people were killed and more than 10 injured when a van crashed into a train in southern Hungary early on Tuesday, derailing a carriage, police said. The incident happened at a crossing in Mindszent near the Hungarian-Serbian border, officers added. In a statement, Hungarian state railways indicated that all those killed had been traveling in the van. It said that 22 people were on the train at the time of the collision. Two were seriously hurt and eight others suffered mild injuries. The van drove onto the tracks, ignoring the red lights, the statement said. The Csongrad-Csanad county police said they had closed the entire width of the road during the on-site inspection and rescue. Local officials later said that the van was registered in Hungary and had been carrying local workers.
