Amsterdam police said they had apprehended a suspect who had taken a hostage at an Apple Store in Amsterdam on Tuesday evening. Police added that the hostage was safe. "We managed to end the situation by hitting the hostage taker with a car when he ran outside," police said on Twitter, adding that the man was being treated for serious injuries. The suspect had carried a pistol and an automatic rifle. He fired at least four shots when police arrived around 6 p.m., Amsterdam police chief Frank Pauw said during a news conference on Wednesday. Earlier, police said they were dealing with a situation involving an armed person in a shop in Leidseplein, a typically busy square in downtown Amsterdam where the Apple store is located. Police did not specify how many people were in the shop when the incident took place, but said that several people were able to leave the building since the hostage situation started. Het Parool newspaper reported that "dozens" of people who had been trapped in the building were released, but one hostage was still in the shop. Leidseplein square was cleared and cordoned off, and a helicopter was flying over head. Dutch public broadcaster NOS reported that the alleged robbery turned into a hostage situation. According to local broadcaster AT5, witnesses said they heard gunshots. "I had to run for my life," one witness was quoted as saying. Police responded to the incident that was reported at around 5:40 p.m. local time (1640 UTC). It was still ongoing two hours later. fb/nm (AP, AFP, dpa, Reuters)
