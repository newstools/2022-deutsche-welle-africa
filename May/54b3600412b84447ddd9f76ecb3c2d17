Finland's legislature on Tuesday approved the country's bid for NATO membership with 188 votes in favor and eight against, Parliament Speaker Matti Vanhanen said. The vote comes after two days of parliamentary debate, during which the foreign affairs committee said that "Russia's long-standing aggressive policies and the goal of dividing Europe into new spheres of influence took on a new dimension after the country's invasion of Ukraine." "Failure to respond would lead to a narrowing of Finland's foreign, security and defense policy," it added. The vote in Parliament was seen a formality, as Finnish President Sauli Niinisto and Prime Minister Sanna Marin had already announced that Finland would go ahead and that minimal opposition was expected. "Our security environment has fundamentally changed," Prime Minister Marin told parliament on Monday at the start of the debate. The vote clears the way for a Finnish application for membership in the Western defense alliance. President Niinisto will now have to sign the application and hand it in to NATO's headquarters in Brussels. Finland and Sweden have said they intend to submit their applications in unison, as the Swedish government voted yesterday to apply for NATO membership. Sweden's Foreign Minister Ann Linde had already signed her country's application on Tuesday morning. Finland joining NATO would be the biggest security policy shift for the country since after World War II, after which the country adopted a policy of military nonalignment and neutrality. Finland shares a 1,300-kilometer (800-mile) long border with Russia, and Moscow has vehemently opposed its membership in NATO. Neutral Finland was invaded by the Soviet Union during World War II in 1939. The Finns fought fiercely during the so-called Winter War, but were forced to cede a huge chunk of the eastern Karelia province to the Soviets under the Treaty of Moscow. wmr/ (AP, Reuters, AFP, dpa)
