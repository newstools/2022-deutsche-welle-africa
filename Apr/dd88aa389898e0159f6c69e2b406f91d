Twelve people were injured, ten by gunfire, on Saturday in a shooting at a shopping center in the US state of South Carolina, authorities said. The incident ocurred in the state's capital, Columbia. Eight individuals required hospitalization, with two in critical but stable condition. The victims ranged in age from 15 to 73. Columbia police chief William Holbrook said authorities believed the shooting at the Columbiana Centre mall was not random but rather occurred between acquaintances. Holbrook said the violence was the result of "some kind of conflict" among armed individuals who knew each other. Three people have been detained in connection with the incident. Initially, the Columbia Police Department said in a tweet, "We have confirmed that people have been injured during the incident — they are receiving medical attention. The extent of injuries unknown at this time." "Officers have been evacuating the (Columbiana Centre) mall and getting people to safety," it added. jcg/sri (Reuters, AP)
