Slovene Prime Minister Robert Golob told DW on Tuesday that the natural gas supply from Russia to Germany is crucial to keeping the European Union strong. Golob, who was in Berlin for talks with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, said the European Union had to stay strong to support Ukraine. "By weakening Europe at its heart in Germany, at its industrial base — it doesn't help Ukraine at all," Golob told DW's Richard Walker. Worries are mounting that a maintenance shutdown of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline from Russia to Germany could be extended because of the war in Ukraine. German experts have warned that a recession could follow if Moscow chooses to turn off the tap for gas to Germany and the European Union. Earlier, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Canada of undermining sanctions against Moscow after Ottawa agreed to return a turbine for Nord Stream 1 to Germany. Golob rejected Zelenskyy's criticism. "I agree with him on many things, but not on this one," Golob said. "If gas flows resume, that's a good sign for Europe and later for Ukraine as well," he added. Scholz said the leaders had "very detailed discussions" about the expansion of renewable energy. Solutions to the gas shortage should come from "within the community," Golob said on his first trip abroad since assuming the premiership. Golob said the construction of gas pipelines and power transmission lines should be boosted in Europe. "In this way we can connect the wind in the north with the sun in the south, and we can make a very strong and stable system, a unified European system," he told journalists.
