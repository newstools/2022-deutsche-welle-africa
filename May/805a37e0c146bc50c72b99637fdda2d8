The situation deteriorated slightly: 81 countries have reported more cases in the past two weeks compared with 14 days earlier.  Based on the newly reported case numbers — which can reflect local outbreaks as well as a nationwide spread — in the past 28 days, countries and territories classify as follows: Oceania: Solomon Islands If you have questions regarding the analysis, please refer to the project's GitHub repository for code and methodology.
