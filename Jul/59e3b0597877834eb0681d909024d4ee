Former German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder has returned to the media spotlight — this time for his choice for a summer vacation 2022: Russia. "I'm on vacation here for a few days. Moscow is a beautiful city," Schröder was quoted as saying. Acting German chancellors' choice of holiday destinations have been less controversial.
