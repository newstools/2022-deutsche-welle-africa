Crocheting for the oceans is an initiative of artists Margaret and Christine Wertheim. They called for fellow crocheters to join them in creating a collective artwork. More than 4000 people from Germany and beyond joined in with the project. The artists assembled thousands of little corals to form a giant reef. It’s currently on display at the Frieder Burda Museum in Baden-Baden, Germany. For each crocheted entry, a donation was made to a project dedicated to protecting the world’s oceans. Now here’s what we’d like to know: what do you do to live more sustainably? -    Produce less trash -    Avoid plastic -    Upcycle -    Not drive a car -    Volunteer work -    Avoid short-haul flights -    Reduce water consumption -    Eat less meat -    Own answer We’re looking forward to reading your answers. A lucky participant will win an exclusive DW rucksack filled with goodies. Closing date for entries is 11 February 2022, 12 noon UTC. All decisions are final. Good luck!
