A stampede at a religious gathering in Liberia has left at least 29 people dead, authorities said Thursday. The religious event, known in Liberia as a crusade, was held at a football pitch in New Kru Town, a working-class suburb of Liberia's capital, Monrovia. Deputy Information Minister Jalawah Tonpo called the tragedy "a sad day for our country." Local media reports that gangsters, wielding knives and machetes, caused the stampede when they attacked worshipers. They say children were among those killed at the gathering. Police spokesperson Moses Carter declined to comment on what caused the incident saying an investigation is underway. Liberia is a highly religious country and the majority of the population of five million are Christians. Liberian President George Weah was expected to visit the site on Thursday afternoon. wd,lo/dj (AFP, Reuters)
