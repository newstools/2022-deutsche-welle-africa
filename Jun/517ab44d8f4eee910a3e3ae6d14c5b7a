A vehicle struck a crowd of people on Tauentzienstrasse in Berlin's Charlottenburg neighborhood on Wednesday. Police said the suspected driver was a 29-year-old German-Armenian living in Berlin. The emergency services told reporters that at least one person had died and eight were wounded, at least five of them with life-threatening injuries. They added that the incident had occurred around 10:30 am local time (0830 UTC). According to witnesses, the man drove his Renault vehicle onto the sidewalk, then pack of the road, until finally crashing into a shop window. "Currently around 60 emergency personnel are at the scene or on their way to the scene," the Berlin fire department wrote on Twitter. Berlin police spokesman Martin Dams said the incident happened near the popular Kurfuerstendamm shopping boulevard in the west of the German capital. Berlin Mayor Franziska Giffey said she was "deeply affected by the incident" and closely watching developments, while European Parliament President Roberta Metsola said that the body's " thoughts are with the loved ones of the person killed and with all the survivors." Authorities said the suspected driver was detained. It was unclear whether the incident was the result of an accident or whether the driver had intentionally driven into the crowd, police spokesman Dams said. Later, police added that the man was detained by passers-by before officers arrived on the scene. The incident took place close to the scene of a fatal attack on December 19, 2016, when Islamist extremist Anis Amri, hijacked a truck, killed the driver and then plowed it into a crowded Christmas market in Breitscheidplatz. The attack killed 11 other people and injured dozens of others. es/fb (AFP, dpa, Reuters)
