Members of the group "Uprising of the Last Generation" on Wednesday protested by blocking access to Germany's three largest airports. The group has been calling on the German government to commit to more legal measures to end food waste, which it says contributes to both hunger and climate change. The climate activists protested in Frankfurt, Munich and Berlin. They said they wanted to disrupt cargo and passenger traffic at airports in those major cities. In Munich, eight activists glued their hands onto the pavement on Wednesday morning in a bid to block two roads leading to the airport. They were taken to a police station at around 9:30 a.m. local time (0830 UTC). Six activists holding banners that read, "Save food, save lives," blocked a road in Frankfurt. Meanwhile, in Berlin, five activists glued their hands onto a road leading to the airport, diverting traffic. Jürgen Trittin of Germany's Green Party told Zeit newspaper that staging "civil disobedience" did not turn protesters into "criminals." He said he could understand those who've been protesting for weeks now. The climate activists have been protesting in Berlin, Hamburg and other German cities for weeks. Their protests involve blockades and hunger strikes. fb/sms (AP, dpa)
