When it comes to movies, Austrian artist Götz Valien goes large. He’s a movie poster painter, one of the best and last representatives of a dying craft. In his Berlin studio, Götz Valien works with canvases weighing more than 400 kilograms and up to 70 square meters in size. He’s created more than 1,000 movie posters over the past 30 years. His work will also be on show on cinema facades across Berlin during this year’s Berlin International Film Festival, the Berlinale. Now we’d like to hear from you: Which movie genre do you like best? We’re looking forward to your responses. The lucky winner will receive an exclusively designed DW rucksack filled with goodies. The closing date is 18 February 2022, 12:00 UTC. The judges‘ decision is final. Good luck!
