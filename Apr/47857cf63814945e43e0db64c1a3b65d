At least six people have died following a shooting in downtown Sacramento, California, local police said Sunday. Sacramento police said there had been "at least 15 shooting victims," with the six fatalities included in that number. Residents have been urged to avoid the area where the violence occurred. Sacramento Police Chief Kathy Lester told reporters that officers were still looking for whoever was responsible. "We are asking for the public's help in helping us to identify the suspects in this and provide any information they can to help us solve this," Lester said. Police did not provide much more detail, other than to say that a "large police presence will remain and the scene remains active." The shooting took place in the downtown area of the city which is full of bars and restaurants. California Governor Gavin Newsom posted a statement on Twitter in which he said gun violence could no longer be tolerated. "Yet another mass casualty shooting — leaving families with lost loved ones, people injured, and a community in grief. We are working closely with law enforcement to monitor the situation. We cannot continue to let gun violence be the new normal," Newsom tweeted. Just over a month ago and in the same city, a man shot and killed his three children along with another person before turning the weapon on himself. In September 2021  the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)  released figures showing that the United States experienced a sharp year-on-year increase in murders and other intentional homicides in 2020, with more than three-quarters being carried out with firearms. The US murder rate is notoriously high among more-developed countries. Of the G20 members, only South Africa, Brazil and Russia tend to record higher murder rates per capita, while Argentina's figures are roughly the same. kb/wd (Reuters, AP)
