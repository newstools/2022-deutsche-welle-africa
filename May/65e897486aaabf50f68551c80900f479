A massive explosion ripped through the Saratoga Hotel in central Havana on Friday. At least 18 people have died due to the explosion, the Cuban government said Friday. At least 70 others were missing, Dr. Julio Guerra Izquierdo, chief of hospital services at the Ministry of Health, told reporters. Local media reported 22 deaths from the blast. At least 14 children were also among those injured, the government said Friday evening. At least two ambulances and five fire trucks were dispatched to the blast site. The office of Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel said the blast was due to a gas leak. The Cuban president has ruled out a bombing as the cause of the explosion. "It's not a bomb or an attack. It is a tragic accident,'' Diaz-Canel said. Diaz-Canel visited the blast site along with other Cuban leaders. Police have cordoned off the blast area, with rescue operations still underway. Cuban state media reported that the hotel was closed, and only employees were inside the building at the time of the blast. A nearby school was also evacuated due to the explosion.  Mexico's Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard expressed solidarity to the victims and those affected by the blast on Twitter. The US Embassy in Havana called on Americans to avoid the affected area and notify loved ones of their well-being. The Hotel Saratoga's building in Old Havana dates back to the 19th century. The five-star hotel has 96 rooms and several bars and restaurants. rm, wd/msh (AP, Reuters)
