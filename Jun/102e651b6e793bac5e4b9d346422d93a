Outbound planes at Hamburg Airport were allowed to take off after all departures were halted during a police operation on Wednesday. The airport gave the all-clear, roughly half an hour after its first statement on the disruption, saying the "police operation" had concluded. As a result of the operation, however, the airport warned that delays were expected for the rest of the day. Federal police — whose responsibilities include border policing and public transport — cleared out the central security checkpoint at the airport after a bag wasn't correctly screened. A passenger exited security with a piece of luggage that wasn't thoroughly checked by agents, a police spokesperson told news agency dpa. The person continued on through security, triggering the police response.
