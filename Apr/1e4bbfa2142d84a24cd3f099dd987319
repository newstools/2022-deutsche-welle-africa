As winter retreats for another year, people in Europe welcome the spring. The days are getting longer and the mercury is climbing, breathing new life into the natural world. At last, the first flowers are emerging, injecting bare landscapes with color and vibrancy. There are around 250,000 species of flower in the world. And now, we’d like to hear which one of them is your favorite. Write to us! As a thank you for taking part, we will be giving away a sweatshirt and a chic cotton bag  from the DW Uncensored Collection for worldwide freedom of speech. DW developed the “Uncensored Collection“ in cooperation with Berlin designer Marco Scaiano . Each piece in the collection is made using 100% organic cotton. And they don’t just look good, they also carry a crucial message: freedom of speech. On the label, you’ll find tips on how to access banned media worldwide. This is my favorite flower: The deadline for entries is 29.04.2022, 12 UTC. The judges‘ decision is final. Good luck!
