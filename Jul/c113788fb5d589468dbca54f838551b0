A cargo aircraft crashed near Paleochori Kavalas in northern Greece late Saturday. According to media reports, the cargo aircraft was traveling from Serbia to Jordan. The plane had reportedly requested clearance to make an emergency landing at nearby Kavala airport, but did not manage to reach it. The aircraft was already in flames before it crashed, people close to the crash site told local media. State-run broadcaster ERT television reported that it was an Antonov aircraft owned by a Ukrainian company. The fire service said in a statement that it has cordoned off the crash site. Local officials said 15 firefighters and seven fire engines had been deployed to the area. More rescuers were on their way. But the firefighters were finding it difficult to approach the site because of the ongoing explosions, officials said. There is no official information about the number of people onboard the plane. But ERT reported that the plane was carrying eight people and that its cargo "was dangerous," including munitions. Police were asking people to leave the area and journalists at the scene to wear masks, the report added. sri/wd (AFP, dpa, AP, Reuters)
