Ferdinand Marcos Jr., the son and namesake of the ousted dictator, took a commanding lead in an unofficial count of more than two-thirds of the votes in Monday's presidential election in the Philippines. With 66.1 percent of election returns counted Marcos had had 21.7 million votes, more than double the 10.3 million votes for Leni Robredo, the vice president, Marcos looks set to replace President Rodrigo Duterte. Election officials said the vote was relatively peaceful despite pockets of violence in the country's volatile south. The Commission on Elections reported problems with some 2,000 malfunctioning vote-counting machines, power outages, missing names on voters' list and otherm but said turnout appeared to have been high. Ferdinand Marcos Jr., also known as "Bongbong," is pitted against the incumbent Vice President Leni Robredo. Marcos Jr. is the son and namesake of a dictator whose two decade rule ended in a public revolt and his family's retreat into exile. He is leading by over 30 percentage points, and has topped every poll this year. This means Robredo will need a late surge or low turnout if she is to win the presidency. Polls opened at 6 am local time (2200 GMT) and are set to stay open longer than usual, till 7 pm, due to COVID precautions. Eight other candidates, including former boxing star Manny Pacquiao, Manila Mayor Isko Moreno and former national police chief Sen. Panfilo Lacson, have lagged far behind in voter preference surveys.  Both the main candidates have promised to prioritize economic recovery after the pandemic. Robredo has pledged to increase investment to tackle climate change, level the playing field for business and promote public-private partnerships. Marcos, 64, has not presented many details about his policies, but is expected to carry ahead the same approach as his predecessor Duterte, pursuing a ruthless consolidation of power. Critics say Marcos is attempting to rewrite the family's controversial history for a youthful electorate, though they believe he is unlikely to replicate his father's authoritarian style of ruling. Duterte's daughter, southern Davao city Mayor Sara Duterte-Caprio, has topped surveys as Marcos Jr.'s vice-presidential running mate. "History may repeat itself if they win. There may be a repeat of martial law and the drug killings that happened under their parents," human rights worker Myles Sanchez told AP news agency regarding a Marcos Jr./Duterte-Caprio victory. Robredo, 57, is a former human rights lawyer and staunch liberal, and has pledged to improve education and welfare, fight poverty and improve market competition if elected. She had narrowly defeated Marcos in the run for vice presidency in 2016. She has criticized Duterte's war on drugs, and condemned the "senseless killings." A win for Robredo would make her the third woman to lead the Philippines after democracy champion Corazon Aquino in 1986 and Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo in 2001. She is running with Francis Pangilinan, a lawyer and senator, and the latest survey put her in second place, with 23% support. tg/wd  (AFP, AP, Reuters)
