Germany's Foreign Ministry advised its citizens to leave Ukraine on Saturday after it said a conflict in the region "cannot be excluded" while fears remain that Russia plans to invade its neighbor. The ministry also said it was closing its consulate in Donetsk, in the east of Ukraine. "Tensions between Russia and Ukraine have again shot up in the last few days due to the massive movements of Russian military units near the Ukrainian border," Berlin's Foreign Ministry said. "If you are currently in Ukraine, make sure that your presence is absolutely necessary. If it is not, leave the country shortly." Despite the call, Germany remains hopeful of finding a solution to the crisis between Russia and Ukraine, Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said, but added, "We must be prepared for all scenarios." Baerbock also said Germany was reducing its representation in Ukraine. "We will keep our embassy open in Kyiv but reduce diplomatic staff," she said. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz is due to visit both Ukraine and Russia for talks next week. The news comes soon after the United States urged its citizens to leave Ukraine, with Secretary of State Antony Blinken warning that Russian forces could invade "at any time." The US, and now Germany, join Belgium, Britain, Denmark, Estonia, Latvia and the Netherlands in calling upon their citizens to leave Ukraine. jsi/dj (dpa, AFP, Reuters)
