France and its European partners in the fight against Islamist insurgents in Mali, as well as Canada, said they would begin a coordinated withdrawal of military resources, a joint statement said on Thursday. Relations have deteriorated between Paris and Bamako since Mali's military leaders reneged on an agreement to hold elections in February, proposing instead to retain power until 2025. The statement was issued by countries deploying troops alongside France's Barkhane counter-terrorism force, which includes Canada, and the Takuba mission, which includes some 14 European nations. "Due to multiple obstructions by the Malian transitional authorities, Canada and the European States operating alongside Operation Barkhane and within the Task Force Takuba deem that the political, operational and legal conditions are no longer met to effectively continue their current military engagement in the fight against terrorism in Mali," the statement said. It added that the countries had "decided to commence the coordinated withdrawal of their respective military resources dedicated to these operations from Malian territory." The Western mission to Mali initially began as one designed to crush Islamic jihadis in the region, but has deteriorated considerably since jihadis have regrouped, aided by two coups in the former French colony since May 2020. Currently, relations between Paris and the military government in Mali — which assumed and consolidated power in the coups — are at an all-time low. Recently Mali's military junta indefinitely postponed scheduled elections, irking Western partners. Another source of controversy is the presence of some 1,000 mercenaries from the Russian private security group Wagner. They arrived after the French began to hand over power at military bases to Malian forces. rc/rt (AFP, AP, dpa, Reuters)
